1. API Integration
Interaction logging: Each customer interaction (e.g., pricing discussions, rental preferences, feedback) can be captured in real-time through your app’s backend. Every time a negotiation occurs, the details are logged into a central database or memory system.

API Calls: You would call the API each time you need assistance with a negotiation. In the request, you would include relevant information about the customer, the equipment they're interested in, any previously discussed pricing, and any prior negotiation history.

2. Storing Interaction Data
Database: Store each negotiation’s details in a structured database (SQL, NoSQL, etc.) with fields like:

Customer Profile: Name, contact details, negotiation preferences, past interactions, etc.

Rental Interaction: What was rented, the agreed price, duration, feedback, and any discounts or special conditions applied.

Negotiation Context: Notes on the negotiation style (assertive, hesitant, price-sensitive), whether they mentioned competitors, objections raised, etc.

Outcome: The final rental price and whether it was a successful deal or lost to a competitor.

Memory Update: This data can be fed back into the system to update the negotiation “memory” each time an interaction occurs, allowing the model to learn.

3. Contextual Memory Management
Memory Snapshot: Before each new negotiation, the app could send a "memory snapshot" to the API, which contains details of the customer’s previous interactions, preferences, and outcomes. This allows me to “remember” past conversations and build context for the current negotiation.

Learning Over Time: Over time, based on the patterns in past interactions (e.g., if the customer typically accepts higher pricing or needs more convincing), the model can adjust strategies accordingly.

4. Reinforcement Learning (Optional)
Feedback Loops: After each negotiation, you can include a feedback mechanism in the app where you rate the outcome (e.g., did you close the deal, did you achieve a target price?). This feedback could help adjust strategies for future interactions.

Continuous Optimization: Based on feedback and the success or failure of previous negotiations, a reinforcement learning loop could be established. If a negotiation strategy works well (e.g., offering a discount when customers show hesitation), the system could give more weight to that approach in the future.

5. Personalized Strategy Evolution
Customer Behavior Patterns: If a customer shows a tendency to rent equipment frequently but bargain hard, the system could remember their price sensitivity and use more aggressive pricing tactics in the future. On the other hand, a customer who values high-end equipment might be offered premium packages or services.

Dynamic Adjustments: The system can also adjust offers in real time based on competitor pricing if the app is integrated with competitor price data. For example, if the customer mentions a competitor’s offer, the API can adjust the rental pricing or package to match or exceed that value.
