1. Data Collection: Web Scraping and Social Media API Integration
Web Scraping: To gather event-related posts from Facebook and Instagram, you’ll need to extract public posts and event details. However, scraping data from these platforms can be tricky due to their terms of service. You can work with their APIs for structured access:

Facebook Graph API: This allows you to query public pages, events, and groups. You’ll need permission from event organizers or public posts about events. For event pages, Facebook provides rich metadata, including location, date, and description.

Instagram Graph API: Instagram offers an API for business accounts that allows you to gather posts, hashtags, and event-related information. Again, you would need either public data or access through business profiles.

Hashtags & Location Tags: Use hashtags (e.g., #wedding2025, #eventplanner) and location tags to filter relevant posts from users or businesses organizing events.

Automated Scraping Approach:

Use Python libraries like beautifulsoup and requests for scraping data directly from Instagram or Facebook, if permissible.

Alternatively, use social media management tools that offer API access to fetch public events from Facebook groups, Instagram posts, etc.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Event Understanding
Event Identification: Once you gather the data (e.g., event posts, descriptions), you'll need AI to analyze and classify the type of events (weddings, corporate events, parties, etc.). You can use NLP techniques to identify keywords like “wedding,” “event,” “party,” and location names.

Entity Recognition: By training an NLP model (like a pre-trained transformer model or using libraries like spaCy or NLTK), you can automatically extract key details from event descriptions such as:

Event type (wedding, birthday, corporate)

Location (city, venue)

Date

Budget (if mentioned)

Contact information (if available)

This information is essential for personalizing your message to event organizers.

3. Automated Message Crafting
Message Templates: Develop personalized message templates for different event types. For example:

For Weddings: "Hi [Organizer's Name], we noticed your upcoming wedding event at [Venue Name] in [Location]. We offer top-quality rental equipment including [type of equipment], perfect for creating memorable experiences. Let us know if you’d like more details or a quote!"

For Corporate Events: "Hi [Organizer's Name], we saw your corporate event scheduled for [Date] at [Venue]. We have a wide range of professional equipment that could suit your event. Contact us for a personalized offer!"

Dynamic Variables: Populate the template with specific event details (e.g., venue, date, location) and any additional custom offers based on the event type.

4. Automation of Messaging
Facebook/Instagram Messaging API: Use Facebook’s Messenger API or Instagram Direct API to send direct messages to event organizers. This would require you to either:

Use a Business Account: If the organizer’s profile is public, you can send a message directly. Alternatively, you could interact with posts through comments or direct messages, provided the API access is allowed.

Integration with CRM: If you have permission from the event organizers or their profiles allow messaging via business accounts, you can integrate a CRM system to automatically send responses, track conversations, and follow up with reminders.
