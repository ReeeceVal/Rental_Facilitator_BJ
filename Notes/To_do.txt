Rental Process Flow 

Customer browses equipment --> Customer chats with chatbot ---> chatbot negotiates pricing and recomends equipment --> Chatbot sends quote --> Customer accepts quote --> App broadcasts rental to employee list --> Employee accepts rental --> Chatbot issues invoice to customer (with stripe payment link) --> Customer makes payment (to confirm rental) --> [Rental day comes] --> Digital contract(Qr code/NFC tag scanning from both employee & customer) --> Employee does the rental --> Digital contract(scanning...) --> Customer & Employee issue a review of eachother --> Invoice payment gets paid out to employees & equipment owners in respective proportions 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 --> Employee rejects rental --> chatbot goes back to negotiation with customer
